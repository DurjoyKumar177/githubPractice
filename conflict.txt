Git conflict is a state in which two or more branches of a Git repository have different versions of the same file. This can happen when two or more developers are working on the same file and they have different changes to make. Git will mark the conflicting areas in the file with special markers, such as "<<<<<<" and ">>>>". This allows the developers to easily identify the conflicting areas and resolve them by choosing one version or by merging the changes.
